From The Simpsons Movie (2007)
Bart Simpson: Boy, you made it! But how?
Santa's Little Helper: [subtitled] I did things no dog should. They will haunt me forever.
Bart Simpson: I love you too

SantasLittleHelper
==================

Pretty self explanatory plugin.
This is a collection of useful little snippets that I used through out various projects. If there is something you would like to add either check it out and modify it the way you want or let me know and I might add it here.

It's dumb just like the famous dog, but it may surprise you.




Example
=======

Once loaded just call available methods.  See  http://github.com/konung/santas_little_helper/blob/master/lib/santas_little_helper.rb for details.

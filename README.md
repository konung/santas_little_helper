From The Simpsons Movie (2007)
Bart Simpson: Boy, you made it! But how?
Santa's Little Helper: [subtitled] I did things no dog should. They will haunt me forever.
Bart Simpson: I love you too

SantasLittleHelper
==================

Pretty self explanatory plugin.
This is a collection of useful little snippets that I used through out various projects. If there is something you would like to add either check it out and modify it the way you want or let me know and I might add it here.

It's dumb just like the famous dog, but it may surprise you.




Example
=======

Once loaded just call available methods.  See  http://github.com/konung/santas_little_helper/blob/master/lib/santas_little_helper.rb for details.


Refactoring
===========

As of version 1.0 some of the methods are being refactored.
To keep it more consistent and to avoid conflicts with Ruby defaults, all custom to_h are converted to .to_human. to_h means to Hash in ruby parlence - so this really is to avoid confusion.
Also refactored some of the system wide methods to make it easier for cover more OS's in the future.


Rails 3 & Gemfile
=================

Sometimes if you are developing in rails on windows and deploying to linux and platform or implementaion lookups don't work and you are tired of parsing RUBY_PLATFORM, you can do this

in Gemfile at the top require:

require "santas_little_helper"
gem "santas_little_helper"

then you can do this:

if jruby?
  gem 'activerecord-jdbcmysql-adapter'
  gem 'jdbc-mysql'
  gem 'jruby-openssl'
  gem 'therubyrhino', :group => :assets
  gem 'puma'
else
  gem 'mysql2', '0.3.11'
  gem  'activerecord-mysql2-adapter'
end

CAREFUL!!!!
===========

Be realy careful about using this GEM - it shivs String, True, False & Nil. May add helpful methods to other classes. Please read source for a an up to day list of helpful methods:


# RUBY_PLATFORM: ruby_platform, ruby_platform?(:os_to_check), windows?, linux?, mac?
# RUBY_PLATFORM: ruby_implemention, ruby_implemention?(:written_in), jruby?, mri?
# RUBY_VERSION: ruby_version, ruby_version?('version_to_check')
# Using Refinements now we can do this ( no more monkey patching like in older versions). So this now only works in version 200 and up.
# For older monkey patching you would have to use older version of the gem
# TrueClass, FalseClass, NilClass , String, Fixnum and Float: to_human, to_i, to_teenager
# String, Fixnum & Float: to_boolean
#   using SantasLittleHelper
